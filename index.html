        <h2>Why Fostering Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Fostering gives pets a calm space outside the shelter. It helps them
          build confidence, learn daily routines, and show their true
          personality to future adopters.
        </p>
        <p>
          You provide food, comfort, and love for a short time. The rescue team
          guides you every step, and your care opens space for more animals in
          need.
